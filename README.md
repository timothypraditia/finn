# Finite Volume Neural Network
This is the code and data repository for the Finite Volume Neural Network method using both Julia and Python (specifically the PyTorch package).
The Python implementation is cleaner and more object-oriented, and it runs relatively faster than the Julia implementation.

For more information on the Julia implementation read [this README file](julia/README.md), and for the Python implementation, read [this README file](python/README.md)
